    <h3>Founded Dec 4, 2023.</h3>
    <p>Aaman and his colleagues came together and started OG’s Only, a new shoe company tasked with the objective of
      distributing Jordan Retro’s to the modern day consumer. They entered the footwear industry to keep retro sneakers
      in circulation, and to allow modern buyers to enjoy Retro Jordans. Another objective of theirs was the
      preservation of historical footwear that had an astronomical impact on the industry and everyone who wore them.
      Shoe companies such as Nike and Adidas have dominated the market and brought so many unforgettable collaborations
      and original creations to the world, but unfortunately many of those works of arts are lost to time as companies
      stop profiting and stop producing their shoes.</p>
